#example1

Generates a decay table with the following structure

(pdg codes)

```
1 --- 3 --- 11
   |     |
   |      - 13
   |     |
   |      - (-13)
   |
    - 2 --- 11
         |
          - (-11)
```

PDG-code 3 also has an optional 3-body dalitz reweighter

#example2

Generates a decay table for the Higgs Portal model, based on arXiv:1909.11670

#example3

Generates a decay table for a Heavy Neutral Lepton model, based on arXiv:1905.00284, including 2-body and 3-body reweighters
